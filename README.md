Basically, this is a voxel fire test I created during my two weeks off from work. During that time, I learned how to work with S&box, and I have to say, it was a lot of fun. 

Unfortunately for me, my free time ends along with my vacation, so I’m afraid I won’t be able to take this idea any further. But I feel like I should share this prototype in case anyone wants to use it. 

The source files are included if you want to check out how the fire works. 

It’s pretty basic and based on the tank from the testbed. Sorry if this is irrelevant or way too basic.
